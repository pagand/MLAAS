## Classification Problems

1. [Iris Flower Classification](Colab/Classification/Classification_Expertlearning_Datu.ipynb): A multi-class classification problem to predict the species of an Iris flower based on sepal and petal measurements. The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. [Diabetes Prediction](Colab/Classification/Classification_Problem1_Datu.ipynb): A binary classification problem to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. 

3. [Wine Quality Classification](Colab/Classification/Classification_Problem2_Datu.ipynb): A multi-class classification problem to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. The dataset is a combination of two datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

4. [Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction](Colab/Classification/Classification_Problem3_Datu.ipynb): A binary classification problem to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.
