1,machine learning,1.1,Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed,"['machine learning', 'ml','computer','program','AI']",concept,5,20,1,Introduction,,
2,ML python packages,1.2,Python is a programming languages becuase of its vast collection of libraries  in Machine Learning.,"['Numpy','Scipy','Scikit-learn','TensorFlow','Keras','PyTorch','Pandas','Matplotlib','python', 'library']",code,5,25,5,Introduction,,
3,introduction to data,2.1,"DATA can be any unprocessed fact, value, text, sound, or picture that is not being interpreted and analyzed. ","['training','test','validation','val','split']",concept,,,2,data,,
4,data preprocessing,2.2,Pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to  data before feeding it to the algorithm and  is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.,"['rescale','normalize', 'whitening','noise','binary','standard',]",code,8,2,7,data,,
5,Cleaning data,2.3,a well-cleaned dataset  can get achieve good results with simple algorithms. It is also very beneficial for computation when the dataset size is large. ,"['Removal','unwanted','Fixing','Structural','Unwanted outliers','Handling missing']",concept,4,7,2,data,,
6, Feature scaling,2.4,Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range.,"['min-max', 'range','magnitude','normalization', 'Standardization']",code,,,5,data,,
7,Handle missing data,4.5,"As Machine Learning algorithms tend to increase accuracy by reducing the error, they do not consider the class distribution.","['Imbalanced','Data Distribution','minority','majority','negligible','SMOTE','Undersampling','NearMiss','unbalanced','up sampling']",code,7,19,12,data,,
8,Introduction to supervised learning,3.1,A type of machine learing when for data both features and labels are available.  It learn from past Experiences with respect to some class of tasks if its Performance in a given Task improves with the Experience.,"['Classification','Regression','label']",concept,5,4,2,Supervised learning,,
