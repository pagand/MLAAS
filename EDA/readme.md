# Explanetory Data Analysis (EDA) Toolkit: v1.3

This toolkit provides a comprehensive environment for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning as a Service (MLAAS). It uses Streamlit, a powerful framework for building machine learning and data science web applications.

## Features

1. **Data Analysis**: Load and analyze datasets with various statistical measures.
2. **Visualization**: Generate plots for better understanding of the data.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using different algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance with various metrics.

## Setting up the Environment

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txtHere is the code for the EDA/MLAAS Toolkit

### Setting ups the environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the server

```
streamlit run app.py
```
